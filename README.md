# CHERI exercise

This is a small exercise to get started with CHERI (on RISC-V, QEMU emulation). 

## Recommended setup

While QEMU with CHERI-RISC-V should run on most Linux/Unix/Mac platforms, we recommend using Ubuntu 18.04 - if needed you can do this using a VM (for example from https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/#ubuntu-1804-vbox). Note that the tools take a while to build (several hours depending on CPU etc), so plan in some time to wait for the compilation to finish.

## Resources

The following resources by the CHERI team from Cambridge are useful:

 * The getting started guide, including installation instructions for the emulator etc: https://ctsrd-cheri.github.io/cheri-exercises/cover/index.html 
 * The `cheribuild` tool: https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribuild.git
 * How to copy files in/out of QEMU to the host is documented here: https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheri-exercises/pull/26
   Essentially, you can simply use `mount_smbfs -I 10.0.2.4 -N //10.0.2.4/source_root /mnt` in the QEMU guest, which will mount the CHERI base directory of the host on `/mnt`.

Also, if you ever need to exit QEMU: press `Ctrl-a` then release and press `x`   

## Task

We will use a (slightly modified) exercise from https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheri-exercises/

 * Fork this repository here (*not* the CHERI exercise one) - we expect you to add your solutions in this README.md where it says *INSERT SOLUTION HERE*. Please make sure you do reasonable commits and commit messages. You can also use other features of Github e.g. issues.
 
 * Assuming that you have installed CHERI-RISC-V in `~/cheri`, make sure your forked repo is cloned to `~/cheri/riscv-exercise`
 
 * Compile `buffer-overflow.c` to a RISC-V binary `buffer-overflow-hybrid` in hybrid capability mode (`riscv64-hybrid`). You can use the `ccc` script from `task/tools` (see the exercise docs for details) for that. What is the full commandline for compilation? 
 
 ```
/home/jiang/cheri/output/sdk/bin/clang -g -O2 -target riscv64-unknown-freebsd --sysroot=/home/jiang/cheri/output/rootfs-riscv64-purecap -fuse-ld=lld -mno-relax -march=rv64gcxcheri -mabi=lp64d -Wall -Wcheri -G0 /home/jiang/cheri/exercise/task/buffer-overflow.c -o /home/jiang/cheri/exercise/task/buffer-overflow-hybrid
 ```
 
 * There is a security flaw in `buffer-overflow.c`. Briefly explain what the flaw is: 
 
 ```
 Use of strcpy() can induce overflow risk, where malicous strings can be copied into the buffer 
 ```
 
 * Start CHERI-RISC-V in QEMU, copy `buffer-overflow-hybrid` to the QEMU guest, and run it with a commandline argument that triggers the mentioned security flaw to overwrite the variable `c` with an attacker-controlled value. Give all the commands you have to run (assuming CHERI is in `~/cheri` and cheribuild in `~/cheribuild`):
 
  ```
  INSERT SOLUTION HERE
  ```
  
 * Now, compile the same program in pure capability mode (`riscv64-purecap`) to `buffer-overflow-purecap`. What happens when you run this program in QEMU with the same input that triggered the flaw in `buffer-overflow-hybrid`? Explain why this happens!
